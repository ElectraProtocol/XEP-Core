What is XEP?
============

The Electra Protocol has been developed with invaluable features in mind to allow merchants, customers, and casual users to incorporate Electra Protocolâ€™s global payment
system into their everyday lives. Since the beginning, Electra has kept its users at the forefront of Project decisions throughout the development process, intending to
transform how the world views payments through cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the XEP Core software, see https://www.electraprotocol.com/, or read the
